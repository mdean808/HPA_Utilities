# HPA Utilities

An app for Hawaii Preparatory Academy students to check their schedule, lunch, grades, and upcoming assignments.

# Quirks

By using a UIWebView to log students into the Learning Management System that HPA uses, I was able to use the cookies it provided to request grades, and assignments.
